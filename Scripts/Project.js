        Title: 'Remix Where‚Äôs Waldo - Crowd Algo üîç',
        resume: `<strong>Godot Jam ‚Äì Invisible</strong> üëÄ.<br>For this project, I wanted to <em>reinvent a concept</em> to elevate it, which allowed me to discover<span style="color: #59cdacff; font-weight: bold;"> the beauty of the boids algorithm.</span>`,
        description: ` <p>In this project, we decided to focus entirely on <span class="highlight">originality</span> ‚ú®, by twisting the theme <span class="highlight">Invisible</span>. As Edgar Allan Poe wrote in <em>The Man of the Crowd</em>, being invisible can also mean not being seen, losing one‚Äôs identity. I studied the <span class="highlight">crowd</span> algorithm to give life and behavior to our crowd, with which the player could interact.</p>

  <h4>Minimalist Artistic Direction</h4>
  <p>This project was a true <span class="highlight">visual challenge</span>. We had only 4 days and a part-time artist. To overcome this, I designed a system to create a fully varied crowd without multiplying assets. We used a <span class="highlight">neutral base body</span> and several accessories to generate unique, lively characters in the crowd.</p>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[Concept art or illustration]</div>

  <h4>Bringing the Crowd to Life</h4>
  <p>Animating each character manually would have been too costly. I implemented a subtle <span class="highlight">‚Äúshake‚Äù effect</span>, simulating walking and giving rhythm to the collective movement.</p>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[GIF or crowd animation]</div>

  <h4>Crowd Algorithm</h4>
  <p>The heart of the gameplay relies on the <span class="highlight">boids</span> algorithm, adapted to simulate believable social interactions. Each individual reacts to the player‚Äôs position while maintaining natural cohesion. This was my first real experience with <span class="highlight">real-time behavioral programming</span>.</p>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[Algorithm diagram or code]</div>

  <h4>Final Result</h4>
  <p>In just four days, we achieved a result true to our intention: expressing invisibility through the crowd. This experience confirmed my desire to specialize in <span class="highlight">gameplay programming</span> and emergent systems.</p>

        Title: 'Miam - Serious Game üçÑ',
        resume: `  <strong>Project for the Belgian Poison Center üçØ</strong><br>
    I had to teach players various concepts, and I did everything to link it to an experience that was both 
    <em>fun</em> and <span style="color: #59cdacff; font-weight: bold;">innovative</span>, so that anyone could enjoy it.`,
        description: ` <p>Project realized for the <span class="highlight">Belgian Poison Center</span> üçØ. The goal of this project was to make <span class="highlight">learning about nutrition</span> accessible and fun, while highlighting the <span class="highlight">benefits of natural products</span> üåøüçé. It also aimed to <span class="highlight">prevent food hazards</span> ‚ò†Ô∏è, teaching players to recognize <span class="highlight">edible</span> ‚Äî or not ‚ùå ‚Äî foods.</p>

  <h4>Main Challenge</h4>
  <p>The biggest difficulty was figuring out how to teach such a <span class="highlight">complex</span> topic through a simple <span class="highlight">mobile game</span>, while keeping the <span class="highlight">player engaged</span>. To do this, I explored all my <span class="highlight">constraints</span> to respond effectively:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The game had to run on <span class="highlight">old phones</span> to reach as many users as possible.</li>
    <li>It had to be <span class="highlight">fun</span>, with a <span class="highlight">simple mechanic</span> familiar to users.</li>
    <li>Players had to <span class="highlight">actually progress</span> and see their <span class="highlight">growth</span>.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[Diagram or mockup of technical constraints]</div>

  <h4>Exploring Mechanics</h4>
  <p>To achieve these goals, I explored several options. I first considered <span class="highlight">titier</span> (a word meaning ‚Äúdesire to win‚Äù), then a <span class="highlight">multiplayer game</span>.</p>
  <p>The multiplayer approach had several advantages: learning with <span class="highlight">friends</span> or <span class="highlight">family</span> increases <span class="highlight">motivation</span>. I then imagined a <span class="highlight">TCG (Trading Card Game)</span> so players could <span class="highlight">compete</span> and <span class="highlight">learn while having fun</span>: <strong>Learn to Win</strong>.</p>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[Example of card or TCG gameplay]</div>

  <h4>Limits of Multiplayer</h4>
  <p>But this approach posed several problems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The player would need to <span class="highlight">know someone</span> to start, limiting the <span class="highlight">potential audience</span>.</li>
    <li>The <span class="highlight">educational core</span> had to be hidden in the TCG without making it too complex.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I kept the idea of <span class="highlight">cards</span>, but with a <span class="highlight">solo</span> approach.</p>

  <h4>Birth of ‚ÄúEat or Not‚Äù Concept</h4>
  <p>Inspired by <span class="highlight">dating apps</span>, I found that the <span class="highlight">like/dislike</span> system was simple and now <span class="highlight">intuitive</span> for many users. Thus was born my concept: <strong><span class="highlight">Eat or Not</span></strong>.</p>
  <p>To make it more engaging, I added a <span class="highlight">humorous layer</span> and a <span class="highlight">survival system</span>: the player must <span class="highlight">survive</span> as long as possible, eating <span class="highlight">natural products</span> to maximize <span class="highlight">points</span> without dying.</p>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[Final gameplay mockup]</div>

  <h4>Result</h4>
  <p>This project allowed me to combine <span class="highlight">pedagogy</span>, <span class="highlight">game design</span>, and <span class="highlight">technical constraints</span>. By simplifying <span class="highlight">gameplay</span>, keeping <span class="highlight">learning</span> central, and adding a <span class="highlight">humorous and survival</span> dimension, I created a <span class="highlight">accessible</span>, <span class="highlight">fun</span>, and <span class="highlight">educational</span> game that runs on a wide range of phones and keeps players <span class="highlight">engaged</span> while learning.</p>

    I wanted to deliver a strong message through <u>gameplay</u>: 
    <span style="color: #e74c3c; font-weight: bold;">it‚Äôs time to act</span>.  
    The game ends with an <span style="color: #8e44ad; font-weight: bold;">inevitable defeat üíÄ</span>,

        description: `  <p>Prototype developed in collaboration with the <span class="highlight">Red Cross ‚úö</span>. This project extends the campaign <span class="highlight">"Living in 2050"</span>.

  The game ends with an <span class="highlight">inevitable defeat üíÄ</span>, reminding that <span class="highlight">resources are not infinite</span>.</p>

  <h4>Project Context</h4>
  <p>We had to create a game to support the <span class="highlight">"Living in 2050"</span> campaign by the Red Cross, an initiative raising awareness about <span class="highlight">climate challenges</span> and their human consequences.  
  The campaign aimed to encourage everyone to <span class="highlight">think today</span> about the actions needed to build a sustainable future.  
  However, we only had <span class="highlight">two days</span> to design a <span class="highlight">pitch</span> and a <span class="highlight">playable prototype</span>.</p>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[Poster or visual for "Living in 2050" campaign]</div>

  <h4>Project Challenge</h4>
  <p>The project had to be <span class="highlight">ultra-accessible</span>:  
  playable by <span class="highlight">everyone</span> in a very short time, while <span class="highlight">making a deep impression on players</span>.  
  We needed to create an experience that sparked <span class="highlight">reflection</span> and encouraged players to <span class="highlight">research the topic</span> themselves.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accessible to a <span class="highlight">wide audience</span>.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Short</span> but <span class="highlight">impactful</span> experience.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Emotional</span> and <span class="highlight">memorable</span> message.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[Simple and accessible UI mockup]</div>

  <h4>Game Concept</h4>
  <p>Players control a <span class="highlight">young orphan girl</span> affected by <span class="highlight">climate migration</span>.  
  They must <span class="highlight">survive as long as possible</span> in a city, relying on <span class="highlight">inhabitants</span> and available <span class="highlight">resources</span>.</p>

  <p>The game occurs in two distinct phases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="highlight">Day phase:</span> explore the city, interact with inhabitants, discover their stories and acts of cooperation. Dialogue evolves daily, reinforcing <span class="highlight">solidarity</span> and <span class="highlight">resilience</span>.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Night phase:</span> manage collected resources to <span class="highlight">survive</span> until the next day.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[Day/Night gameplay phase diagram]</div>

  <p>Each day reflects the <span class="highlight">consequences</span> of the player‚Äôs previous actions, creating a natural <span class="highlight">learning loop</span>.  
  This progression makes every attempt more <span class="highlight">meaningful</span>.</p>

  <h4>An Inevitable Ending</h4>
  <p>To reinforce the campaign‚Äôs message ‚Äî <strong>act now, not in 2050</strong> ‚Äî we designed a <span class="highlight">level design</span> that <span class="highlight">gradually depletes resources</span>.  
  No matter the strategy, the player cannot <span class="highlight">survive more than three days</span>.  
  This <span class="highlight">inevitable death</span> embodies the idea that, despite good intentions, <span class="highlight">if we don‚Äôt act today</span>, future generations cannot be saved.</p>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[End screen showing inevitable defeat]</div>

  <h4>Result</h4>
  <p>In just <span class="highlight">two days</span>, we created a prototype that is <span class="highlight">emotional</span> and <span class="highlight">impactful</span>, using <span class="highlight">gameplay</span> as a genuine <span class="highlight">vehicle for social message</span>.  
  This project reinforced my belief that <span class="highlight">video games</span> are a <span class="highlight">powerful medium</span> to <span class="highlight">educate</span>, <span class="highlight">move</span>, and <span class="highlight">make people think</span>.</p>

    We wanted to make a <em>simple promise</em> to our players, but one that meant a lot.  
    So we told them: <span style="color: #59cdacff; font-weight: bold;">‚ÄúYou can climb.‚Äù</span><br>
    For this, <span style="color: #59cdacff; font-weight: bold;">I had to create an entire system and a <em>3D logic</em> inside a 2D engine</span>`,
        description: ` <p>First project with multiple <span class="highlight">developers üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª</span>.  
  We had few guidelines, except one: the game had to be <span class="highlight">2D</span>.  
  We wanted to offer players a <span class="highlight">simple mechanic</span>, yet rich in possibilities.  
  This gave birth to our promise: <strong>‚ÄúYou can climb.‚Äù üßó</strong></p>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[Team image or project prototype]</div>

  <h4>Simple Concept, Ambitious Execution</h4>
  <p>We wanted this simple phrase to open <span class="highlight">new gameplay and level design perspectives</span>.  
  To achieve this, I had to create <span class="highlight">3D logic inside a 2D engine</span> ‚Äî a real technical but exciting challenge.</p>

  <h4>Major Technical Challenges</h4>
  <p>This project proved far more complex than a simple <span class="highlight">Sokoban</span>.  
  My team and I took a <span class="highlight">risky but unique approach</span>: recreating <span class="highlight">3D depth</span> in a 2D world.</p>

  <p>Our game relied on a <span class="highlight">specific camera angle</span>, requiring manipulation of <span class="highlight">transformation matrices</span> to properly place grid tiles.  
  Once this base was set, we had to design a coherent <span class="highlight">physical relief</span> allowing players and boxes to move in ‚Äú3D‚Äù.</p>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[Grid system diagram or simulated 3D visualization]</div>

  <p>To do this, I devised a <span class="highlight">simple but effective logical calculation</span>, linking ‚Äúvisual‚Äù coordinates to <span class="highlight">actual positions</span> in the game space.  
  This system became the core of the <span class="highlight">spatial simulation</span>.</p>

  <h4>Explosion of Possibilities</h4>
  <p>Our mechanic seemed simple but generated a <span class="highlight">huge variety of situations</span>: over <span class="highlight">50 configurations</span> possible, with different <span class="highlight">levels</span> (0 to 3), <span class="highlight">stacked blocks</span>, <span class="highlight">climbing directions</span>, and <span class="highlight">target blocks</span>.</p>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[Illustration of different block configurations]</div>

  <p>I had to write <span class="highlight">highly modular code</span> to maintain a clear and adaptable structure.  
  But this also complicated <span class="highlight">pathfinding</span>.</p>

  <h4>Final Result</h4>
  <p>The result was extremely satisfying: players could <span class="highlight">climb, move, push</span> and <span class="highlight">solve puzzles</span> that seemed impossible at first.  
  This project taught me <span class="highlight">level design, modular programming, and 2D/3D logic</span>, a solid foundation for future projects.</p>

  <h4>Gameplay Loop</h4>
  <p>Players face waves of enemies with increasing difficulty.
